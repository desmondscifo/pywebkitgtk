# Introduction #

We can't build the latest pywebkitgtk in Ubuntu Hardy as it includes a really old version of WebKit.

To circumvent this and still be able to use the recent pywebkitgtk, the Gwibber folks have provided PPA for Hardy. These ppas can be found at

  * http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-team/ubuntu/pool/main/p/pywebkitgtk/
  * https://launchpad.net/gwibber

It includes packages for Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10.
